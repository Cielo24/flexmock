Current Status: Not Ready For Use

FlexMock provides a mock/stub library for Python.
It is inspired by Ruby's FlexMock, however I'm not going for
feature parity with the Ruby version and instead focusing on
core functionality.

Why another mock library for Python? Because the ones out there now
make me cringe after having used Ruby and its nice testing tools.
